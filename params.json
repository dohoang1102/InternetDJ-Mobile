{"body":"InternetDJ Mobile\r\n=================\r\n\r\nHere's the xCode source code that runs the http://www.InternetDJ.com iPhone Mobile App (download for free in the app store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/internetdj/id513783143 ). It is PhoneGap based with Xtify Push (http://www.xtify.com) and jQuery Mobile plugins. It uses JavaScript to consume InternetDJ Web Services APIs (http://www.internetdj.com/developers/). Feel free to improve upon it, or lift for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enable Xtify Push services you have to get your own free app key at http://console.xtify.com and setup your Apple push provisioning profile at http://developer.apple.com -- full setup instructions here: http://developer.xtify.com/display/sdk/Xtify+iOS+2.x+Implementation+Guide\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
