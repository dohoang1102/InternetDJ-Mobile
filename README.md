InternetDJ
==========

Here's my source code that runs my InternetDJ iPhone App that you can download for free in the app store (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/internetdj/id513783143). It is PhoneGap based with Xtify Push and jQuery Mobile plugins. It uses JavaScript to consume InternetDJ Web Services APIs (www.internetdj.com/developers/). Feel free to improve upon it, or lift for your own purposes.
