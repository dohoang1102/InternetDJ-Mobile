InternetDJ
==========

Here's the source code that runs the http://www.InternetDJ.com iPhone Mobile App (download for free in the app store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/internetdj/id513783143 ). It is PhoneGap based with Xtify Push (http://www.xtify.com) and jQuery Mobile plugins. It uses JavaScript to consume InternetDJ Web Services APIs (http://www.internetdj.com/developers/). Feel free to improve upon it, or lift for your own purposes.

If you want to enable Xtify Push services you have to get your own free app key at http://console.xtify.com and setup your Apple push provisioning profile at http://developer.apple.com -- full setup instructions here: http://developer.xtify.com/display/sdk/Xtify+iOS+2.x+Implementation+Guide
